<p>A game-turned-game engine for platformer games using Monogame engine, written in C#</p>
<p>Cancelled platformer game due to lack of assets, overestimation of work for a one-man-team, and lack of originality</p>

<p>Project Shards was built off old XNA C# sample code, devloped by Microsoft, for a basic platformer that had movement, jump, coin collecting, moving enemies, platform, physics, and sprite animation.</p>
<p>For original XNA platformer sample program and code, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd254918%28v=xnagamestudio.31%29.aspx">Here</a></p>
